# Sidewalk Widths San Jose

[View the map here](https://www.codeforsanjose.com/sidewalk-widths/)

This is a Mapbox-hosted map of the City of San José with a color-coded overlay of sidewalk widths, built in response to COVID-19. It was inspired by [Sidewalk Widths NYC](https://www.sidewalkwidths.nyc/) and uses the same color scheme. The sidewalk data was acquired from the Department of Public Works' [GIS Spatial Data Download](https://www.sanjoseca.gov/your-government/departments-offices/public-works/resources/gis-data-downloads) and processed with PostgreSQL.

This is a "finished" project and, except for any bugs that might arise, does not need any further work from Code for San José volunteers. If you are interested in projects like this, involving maps and geospatial systems, check out the [OpenStreetMap project](https://github.com/codeforsanjose/OSM-SouthBay).
